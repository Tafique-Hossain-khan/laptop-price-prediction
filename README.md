## Project Description
This project aims to predict the price of a laptop based on various features such as company, type, screen size, resolution, CPU, RAM, memory, GPU, operating system, and weight. The goal is to provide an estimated price for a laptop given these attributes.

## Features
- **Company**: The manufacturer of the laptop.
- **TypeName**: The type or category of the laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Gaming).
- **Inches**: The screen size of the laptop in inches.
- **ScreenResolution**: The resolution of the laptop's screen.
- **Cpu**: The processor model of the laptop.
- **Ram**: The amount of RAM in the laptop.
- **Memory**: The storage capacity of the laptop.
- **Gpu**: The graphics card model of the laptop.
- **OpSys**: The operating system of the laptop.
- **Weight**: The weight of the laptop.
- **Price**: The output feature, representing the price of the laptop.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for deploying the model.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
